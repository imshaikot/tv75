# tv75 (for Tizan based samsung TV)
A tiny tizen app (for Samsung TV) to watch Bangladeshi Cricket matches. 
ATM there are few channels available to circulate. You can use stadard Samsung TV's standard remote arrow up key to change channel.

## Install

You can either compile the app by yourself using Tizen SDK or just install `.wgt` file in your TV. Remember the (compiled `.wgt`) 
build is a development build (not properly signed) so you need to enable DEVELOPER MODE on your TV (search Google)

### DISCLAIMER

This is an experimental project (2-3 hour spent), so if it doesn't work on your TV - it is not the app then, its your shitty TV. Get a new one!!
